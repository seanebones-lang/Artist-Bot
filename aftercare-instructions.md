2. **Leave it on for 12-24 hours**
3. **Remove it, preferably in the shower, by peeling it off slowly and gently, ideally under warm running water**
4. **Wash the tattoo thoroughly with antibacterial soap and warm water, avoiding harsh soaps or excessive scrubbing**
5. **Pat it dry with a clean paper towel**

## 🩹 Second Application (4-5 days)

1. **Reapply a new layer of Tegaderm, ensuring it covers the entire tattoo and extends beyond the edges**
2. **Leave it on for 4-5 days**
3. **Some fluid accumulation under the bandage is normal**

## 🩹 Final Removal and Aftercare (After 4-5 days)

1. **Remove the second layer of Tegaderm in the shower, similar to the first removal**
2. **Wash the tattoo again with antibacterial soap and warm water**
3. **Let it air dry completely**
4. **Apply a thin layer of fragrance-free lotion (like Lubriderm, Curel, or Aveeno) as needed**

6. **Continue to wash and moisturize the tattoo as needed for the next few weeks**

## ⚠️ Important Considerations

### Fluid Accumulation
- Some fluid (blood plasma, ink) under the bandage is normal and doesn't indicate a problem

### Redness and Breakouts
- Redness or breakouts where the Tegaderm adheres to non-tattooed skin is also normal

### Allergic Reactions
- Allergic reactions to Tegaderm are rare, but if you experience severe redness, itching, or rash, remove the bandage and consult your artist

### Sun Protection
- Protect your tattoo from the sun with sunscreen after it's fully healed

### Listen to Your Artist
- Your tattoo artist may have specific instructions for your tattoo, so always follow their advice
